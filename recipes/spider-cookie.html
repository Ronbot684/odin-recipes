  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A fun and quick little treat that you can make alongside your kids. This is a modified version of the original recipe to exclude peanut-butter for those who have allergies. Takes about an hour or so to make.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup of vegetable shortening</li>
    <li>½ cup of packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup of white sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup of white sugar for rolling</li>
    <li>24 chocolate truffles, chilled</li>
    <li>48 decorative candy eyeballs</li>
    <li>½ cup of prepared chocolate frosting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet(s) with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Beat shortening, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat egg into the creamy mixture until fully incorporated. Stir milk and vanilla extract into the mixture until smooth.</li>
    <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl, then add to the large bowl and stir until completely incorporated into a dough.</li>
    <li>Divide and shape dough into 48 balls.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/4 cup of white sugar into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll the dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange them about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet(s).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown (about 10 to 12 minutes). Remove cookies from oven and quickly press a dimple into the center of each cookie using the blunt end of a wooden spoon. Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Cut each chocolate truffle in half. Put one piece atop each cookie with the rounded side facing upwards.</li>
    <li>Spoon frosting into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip, or use a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Dab a small amount of frosting onto the back of each candy eyeball and stick two onto each chocolate truffle to resemble eyes. Then, along the right and left of the eyes, pipe frosting in four thin lines, starting at the base of the truffle and moving out towards the edge of the cookie, to resemble spider legs.</li>
    <li>Let frosting harden at room temperature (about 30 minutes). Serve after hardening or store cookies in an airtight container.</li>
