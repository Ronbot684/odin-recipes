  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A wonderfully delicious recipe making a tiramisu cheesecake without the use of any baking. Very coffee flavored, so if that's your thing, this is for you. Takes about 7 hours to make.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup of boiling water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of instant espresso coffee powder, divided</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons of coffee liqueur, divided</li>
    <li>2 (8-ounce) packages of mascarpone cheese, softened</li>
    <li>2 (8-ounce) packages of cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup of powdered sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 (7-ounce) package of crisp Italian ladyfingers (savoiardi), divided</li>
    <li>1 cup of sliced almonds, toasted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup of butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 cups of whipping cream</li>
    <li>unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting, as needed</li>
    <li>(optional) 12 chocolate covered espresso beans</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients. Pour boiling water into a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon of instant espresso coffee powder until dissolved. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature (30 minutes). Once cooled, add 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. You will use this mixture to soak the ladyfingers for the filling.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, for the filling, beat mascarpone and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium until smooth. Beat in the powdered sugar, the remaining tablespoon of instant espresso coffee powder, and salt until well combined. Beat in vanilla and the remaining 4 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. Cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator (30 minutes).</li>
    <li>For the crust, combine 12 ladyfingers, almonds, and white sugar in a food processor. Pulse to fine crumbs. Remove mixture from food processor and stir in butter until mixture is moistened.</li>
    <li>Pat crumb mixture (the crust) evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan in the freezer until set (15 minutes).</li>
    <li>Beat cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer until it forms stiff peaks.</li>
    <li>Stir 1/4 of the whipped cream into the filling mixture to lighten. Fold remaining whipped cream into the filling mixture until combined.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the filling over the crust.</li>
    <li>Dip remaining 12 ladyfingers, one at a time, into coffee mixture to coat, about 1 second each. They will soften quickly and break easily. Place atop the filling in the pan, breaking to fit as needed. Spread remaining filling evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
    <li>Cover and chill in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top of the cheesecake. Loosen sides of pan with a thin spatula, then remove them.</li>
    <li>(Optional): Garnish each slice with a chocolate covered espresso bean.</li>
