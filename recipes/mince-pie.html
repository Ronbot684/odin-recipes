  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A quick treat/dessert to enjoy at any point, though usually in the colder weather. Traditionally, mince pies are filled with mincemeat, which is a combination of dried fruits, warming spices, sugar, nuts, distilled spirits, and mutton or beef suet, however most modern recipes don't use meat. Takes about 45 minutes to make.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup of confectioners' sugar, divided</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>⅔ cup of butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of grated orange zest</li>
    <li>¼ cup of ice water</li>
    <li>¾ cup of prepared mincemeat pie filling</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Sift flour, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to mix in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in orange zest.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with ice water and gather dough into a ball. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
    <li>Cut out approximately 18 (3-inch) diameter circles, and 18 (2-inch) circles, re-rolling dough as needed.</li>
    <li>Line muffin cups or mini tart tins using the 3-inch pastry circles. Fill each pastry cup with about 1 tablespoon of mincemeat filling. Top with the 2-inch pastry circles, pinching circles together to seal the edges. Brush the top of each pie with egg.</li>
    <li>Bake pies in preheated oven until tops are golden brown (about 15 to 20 minutes). Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with remaining 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar just before serving.</li>
