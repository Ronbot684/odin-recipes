# odin-recipes
First website for The Odin Project

This project is the first project in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.
This project will make a website that links to a few recipes.
This will be created with HTML for now, but later it'll have CSS added to it.
For now, I'll be showing simple HTML knowledge that I have learned through both The Odin Project and Codecademy.
